;; A Literate Programming Environment for configuration files and scripts

;; tangld is an Emacs package that provides 'dotfiles management' features
;; using Literate Programming paradigms.  Using org-mode files with source
;; blocks and the tangle functionality, Emacs can be used as an IDE to
;; document, build, and install configuration files, scripts and other
;; files on a system.  More details are available in the README.org file.

;;; Code:

(defun tangld-check ()
  "Run tests"
  (interactive)
